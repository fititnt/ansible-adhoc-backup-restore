`abr` To Do list
##################

.. note::

  While there is other things to improve, this page mentions what the initial
  maintainer already know that is possible or even already done on other
  projects and may eventually implement on `abr`

********************************
Publish `abr` on Ansible Galaxy
********************************

As 2020-02-15 this repository still private. As soon as it become public, we
should enable it.

*******************************************
Publish `abr` documentation on readthedocs
*******************************************

As 2020-02-15 this repository still private. As soon as it become public, we
should enable it.

***********************
MVP of molecule tests
***********************

As 2020-02-15 this repository does not have even minimum molecule tests. While
the maintainer already implemented this on
`fititnt.ansible_syntactic_sugar <https://github.com/fititnt/ansible-syntactic-sugar>`_
and
`fititnt.ap_application_load_balancer <https://github.com/fititnt/ap-application-load-balancer>`_
a project with full workflow of backup/restore may need (I suppose) at least
use the non-default molecule folder.
